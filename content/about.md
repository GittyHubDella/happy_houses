# Who are we?

After vacations to the Coachella Valley with my family over the years, I fell in love with the community, lifestyle and weather of the desert. In 2011 I decided to relocate from my home in Colorado to La Quinta and begin a career in Real Estate. As fate would have it, I met my future Bride Sarye while attending Real Estate school. Today Sarye and I have two lovely girls Siena and Sage. Our Real Estate practice has blossomed as well.

We have been recognized as being in the Top 1% of all Realtors in the Coachella Valley based on closed sales volume. We can't tell you how much we enjoy meeting new people, building quality relationships and helping families find the home of their dreams or selling their existing homes. Most of all it's the lasting friendships we've built with our Clients long after they've moved into their new home.

As full time real estate professionals we are committed to providing our Clients with service and competence that's second to none. We are excited to serve you too
